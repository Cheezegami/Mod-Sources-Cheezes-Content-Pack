Place the items you wish to update the displayName and toolTips of into the data folder. Then run the executable ONCE, and the files should be updated.

NOTES:
Only run the executable once.
If it doesn't work properly, don't blame me.
Put only the files you wish to update in the data folder, and none others.
The source file is in the source folder.
